## 🔍 Search Algorithm Analysis

### 🔸 Linear Search
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- Scans each element one by one.
- Suitable for **small or unsorted datasets**.
- Simple to implement but inefficient for large datasets.

### 🔸 Binary Search
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- Requires the array to be **sorted**.
- Much faster than linear search on large datasets.
- Efficient but only works on sorted data.

---

### ✅ Recommendation
- Use **Binary Search** when working with large, sorted product lists.
- Use **Linear Search** when sorting is not feasible or the dataset is small.
